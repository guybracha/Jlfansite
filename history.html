    <h1>How it all begins?</h1>
     <p>Started back at early 1960, in The Brave and the bold #28 by writer gardner fox, artist mike sekowsky, and editor julius schwartz.</p>
     <p>After a few succesful revivals of the Flash and Green Lantern, schwartz have decided to revive an old superhero team: the justice society of america, but with a twist... </p>
     <p>Following the popularity of the american baseball leagues, the brilliant editor decided to rename the justice society to the Justice League of America.</p>
     <p>The league's first apperance was in issue number 28 of DC's the brave and the bold, where they fought againsts Starro the conquerer.</p>
     <p>And after a two back-to-back features at the brave and the bold, by late 1960, DC has decided to give the justice league their own title: Justice League of America vol. 1</p>
